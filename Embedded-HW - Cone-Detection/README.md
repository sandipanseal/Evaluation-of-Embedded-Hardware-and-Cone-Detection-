In the folder 'materials' you can find the PDFs describing your task.
Also in the python file 'cone_hsv.py' an example visual cone recognition can be found which uses OpenCV.
Feel free to use this as inspiration for your GPU implementation.

Please add your implementation in the respecting folder.
